## About

The Black-Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. This mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of derivatives based on other investment instruments, taking into account the impact of time and other risk factors. This project aims to give a demonstration of the Black-Scholes Merton model, demonstrating the various outputs given a number of preset values, and also comparing it
to the monte carlo geometric random walk simulation version.

## Built With

    Python, Jupyter Notebooks

## Getting Started

    Prerequisites & Dependencies
    numpy, scipy, matplotlib

## Roadmap

Future plans of the project involve

    Adding more visualisations for the model
    Adding customisable values for input
    Integrating machine learning adjustments to the model
